## Peppol Delivery Network 

Peppol uses the eDelivery Network to connect different eProcurement systems by establishing a set of common business processes and technical standards.

### Peppol SMP (Service Metadata Publisher)(publishing the capabilities of Peppol participants)

All Peppol participating organizations (such as contracting authorities or suppliers) publish their receiving capabilities (delivery addresses, business processes and document types supported, etc.) using a separate service called a Service Metadata Publisher (SMP)

### The Peppol SML (Service Metadata Locator)(central registration system for addressing)

In order to deliver electronic documents from a sender to the correct recipient, all Peppol Access Points need to know about each other and the participants they support.
