# AS4
## What is AS4?

Applicability Statement 4 (more commonly known as AS4) is a communication protocol that is used for B2B and B2G document exchange. 
AS4 was developed for ebXML messaging services by OASIS (the Organisation for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards). It is based on SOAP/WSDL and uses HTTP as its communication protocol. As AS4 utilises the HTTP protocol, document exchange can be secured via Transport Layer Security (TLS). In the context of Peppol the exchange format of choice will remain the well established and accepted UBL (Universal Business Language) format.
