# [GitHub billing](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/billing)

Any free account has limited minutes for use(2000 action minutes per month for private repositories. Limits are per user/organization). By default, Actions will stop running when they are exceeded.

# [Getting started with the REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/guides/getting-started-with-the-rest-api)

## Authentication üêæ

### Basic authentication

```
curl -user "username" https://api.github.com

```

#### To Authenticate with the GitHub API we will use [OAuth and personal access tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/other-authentication-methods#via-oauth-and-personal-access-tokens)

```
$ curl -i -u username https://api.github.com/users/octocat

OR

$ curl -i -u your_username:$token https://api.github.com/users/octocat

```

#### Withoud authenication we only have visibility to the public information. For example:

* Info only about public repositories

```
$ curl -i https://api.github.com/users/octocat/repos
```


* Info about public + private repositories

```
$ curl -i -H "Authorization: token $TOKEN"  https://api.github.com/users/octocat/repos

```
#### Try to get your own user profile

```
curl -i -u your_username:your_token https://api.github.com/user
```
