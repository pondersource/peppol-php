# Goal

The goal is a clear design with easily modifiable code. Each method/class must have a few functions as possible.

Thinking for 5 packages with the use of object-oriented python

# packages
sender - receiver - input- output - invoice

Invoice must implement as abstract to make its fields obvious. For now, we will handle the ubl as a simple object(not an XML file. So we don't need the XML librarie for this step). 

Initially, we will implement our application in a local network.

The Soap methods will be added probably at input- output packages.

# Next step
Implement the basic architecture in python / continue the research
